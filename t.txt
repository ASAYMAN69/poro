ðŸ§­ Phase 2 Corrective Prompt for Frontend/UI DeveloperObjective: Correct and complete the UI for "HWisExhausting" based on the previous detailed specifications. The previous attempt was structurally correct but visually lacked the required modern aesthetic, layout robustness, and, critically, omitted the core feature: the Weekly Homework Schedule/Calendar.The coder must strictly adhere to the Global Technical & Design Constraints from the prior prompt (BEM, rem units, A11y, minimal JS).1. Global Aesthetic & Structural EnforcementEnforce CSS Variables: The entire color palette (Primary, Card, Text, Background) must be defined in a :root block using CSS variables. The theme toggle is non-functional if variables aren't used.Enforce Layout: The layout must use Flexbox or Grid with appropriate gap and padding. Avoid large white gaps; use the specified background color (#f8f9fc) for Light Mode.Aesthetics: Every card, button, and navigation item must use rounded corners (8px) and a subtle shadow (e.g., box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)). The current UI is too flat.2. Page-Specific Corrections & CompletenessA. Global Navigation & Header CorrectionNavbar Structure: Re-implement the header. The current version lacks visual hierarchy.Left: "HWisExhausting" (logo/text)Center: Current Date/Time Placeholder (remove the text "Today's date is:")Right: Links (Dashboard, Assignments, Calendar, Settings) and a Profile Icon (must be an actual icon, not plain text).Aesthetics: The header must have a distinct background color (e.g., pure white in Light Mode) and be sticky/fixed to the top. The links should have clear hover states using the Primary color.B. ðŸ“… /dashboard (The Core Fix)The previous attempt FAILED to build the main weekly schedule. This must be the primary focus.B.1. Main Layout (Two-Column Grid)The Dashboard content area must be split into a CSS Grid on desktop:Column 1 (Left): 75% Width. This is for the Weekly Calendar/Schedule.Column 2 (Right): 25% Width. This is for the Auxiliary Cards (Upcoming Assignments, Recent Grades, Announcements).B.2. Weekly Calendar Component (Left Column)Implementation: Build the full $7$-day calendar using CSS Grid (repeat(7, 1fr)).Day Cards: Each day must be a distinct card/box with:The Day Name (Sun, Mon, etc.)The Date NumberA section for Homework Cards (Placeholder).Aesthetics:Add a distinct, visible border around the entire calendar block.Highlight the Current Day with the Primary Accent Color border.Homework Cards: Use the required colored tags (vertical bar or small colored pill) for subject differentiation (Math = blue, Physics = red).B.3. Auxiliary Cards (Right Column)The cards (Upcoming Assignments, Recent Grades, Announcements) should now be stacked vertically in the $25\%$ right column.Apply the required rounded corners and subtle shadow to each card.Ensure proper vertical spacing (gap: 1rem;) between these cards.C. Floating Action Button (FAB)Must be implemented: The floating bottom-right circular + button, with its CSS-only hover effect, is still required on the Dashboard page.D. /profile and /settingsEnsure these pages adopt the fixed header/navbar, two-column layout (if appropriate for content), and the new aesthetic (shadowed cards, rounded corners, Primary color accents).3. Mandatory Mobile View CorrectionMobile Grid Collapse: When the screen width is $\le 767\text{px}$:The Navbar must switch to the minimal logo/icon view.The Weekly Calendar must switch from the 7-column grid to the horizontal scrollable Flexbox view (each day fixed width, container overflow-x: scroll;).The Auxiliary Cards (Upcoming, Grades, Announce) must collapse to a full-width vertical stack below the Calendar component.Final DirectiveThe resulting UI must be visually compelling, clearly structured, and look like a finished productâ€”not a wireframe. Prioritize the aesthetic implementation of the weekly calendar component and the correct application of CSS variables for the color scheme.
